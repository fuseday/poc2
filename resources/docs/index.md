### Docker forward ports

To avoid collisions with default ports, defaults are:
- HTTP on 80
- mysql on 33060

After the environment is running, you can access your site on your host machine,
by pointing your browser to https://localhost:8000
Also, if you want to connect to MySQL database with a client software, use
localhost as server and 33060 as port.
